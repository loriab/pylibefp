============
Introduction
============

Overview
========

|pylibefp| provides a Python API to Ilya Kaliman's libefp library
https://libefp.github.io/ through bindings generated by pybind11.
Pure EFP and SCF/EFP calculations are accessible.

Install
=======

Clone the repo and build with CMake (e.g.
https://github.com/loriab/pylibefp/blob/master/.travis.yml#L89-L99). At
present, needs a non-standard version of libefp (mainly to install
additional headers). CMake constructed as a superbuild, so it will grab
the source it needs for libefp and pybind11. Bring your own CMake and
Python (and various tools if you want to build docs). Eventually will
be a conda package.

Usage
=====

See tests (https://github.com/loriab/pylibefp/tree/master/tests)
for example usage. All of libefp's tests are in test_efpefp and
test_libefp. Examples of option setting are in test_opts. Example of
SCF/EFP (using |PSIfour| for integrals) is in test_scf.
